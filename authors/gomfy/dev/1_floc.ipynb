        "We start with a straightforward facility location problem, demonstrating how to utilize AMPL and the `amplpy` module within a Jupyter Notebook to find a solution. \n",
        "As the series progresses, the problem complexity will increase, evolving into a two-stage stochastic programming problem.\n",
        "From the third notebook onwards, our focus will pivot from modeling to algorithm development in AMPL. \n",
        "We'll explore four distinct approaches to implementing the Benders decomposition: initially through AMPL scripting, then by shifting control flow to the `amplpy` module. \n",
        "This transition allows us to illustrate how subproblems can be solved in parallel. \n",
        "Lastly, we'll introduce our AMPLS library, which facilitates exporting AMPL model instances to persistent solver representations. \n",

        "Facility location decisions are crucial and often involve significant investment for both public and private sector entities, bearing profound social, economic, and environmental implications. \n",

        "\n",
        "Given the high stakes of these decisions, engineers and analysts have developed sophisticated models to aid organizations in identifying optimal locations. \n",
        "These models take into account a variety of factors, including but not limited to, transportation costs, proximity to customers and suppliers, labor availability, customer demand, and environmental regulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The challenge is compounded when considering the uncertainty inherent in future conditions. \n",
        "Factors such as fluctuating market demands, changes in infrastructure, and unpredictable socio-economic developments require a robust approach to facility location. \n",
        "Therefore, as we will explore in the second notebook of this series, engineers frequently utilize stochastic models and robust optimization techniques. \n",

        "The Python API will allow us to instantiate an AMPL object and utilize its methods to read model and data files, configure options, issue solve commands, and refresh our data as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that `customer_demand` is the only parameter that varies across the different scenarios in our data files. \n",
        "This observation suggests that it might not be necessary to create three distinct data files and reset all our data after each solve, as the AMPL script above does. \n",
        "Instead, we can begin with a single data file for the low demand scenario, `floc_low.dat`. \n",
        "For the medium and high scenarios, we can simply use AMPL's `update data` command to modify the `customer_demand` parameter accordingly."
