        "We start with a straightforward facility location problem, demonstrating how to utilize AMPL and the `amplpy` module within a Jupyter Notebook to find a solution. \n",
        "As the series progresses, the problem complexity will increase, evolving into a two-stage stochastic programming problem.\n",
        "From the third notebook onwards, our focus will pivot from modeling to algorithm development in AMPL. \n",
        "We'll explore four distinct approaches to implementing the Benders decomposition: initially through AMPL scripting, then by shifting control flow to the `amplpy` module. \n",
        "This transition allows us to illustrate how subproblems can be solved in parallel. \n",
        "Lastly, we'll introduce our AMPLS library, which facilitates exporting AMPL model instances to persistent solver representations. \n",

        "Given the high stakes of these decisions, engineers and analysts have developed sophisticated models to aid organizations in identifying optimal locations. \n",

        "\n",
        "The challenge is compounded when considering the uncertainty inherent in future conditions. \n",
        "Factors such as fluctuating market demands, changes in infrastructure, and unpredictable socio-economic developments require a robust approach to facility location. \n",
        "Therefore, as we will explore in the second notebook of this series, engineers frequently utilize stochastic models and robust optimization techniques. \n",
