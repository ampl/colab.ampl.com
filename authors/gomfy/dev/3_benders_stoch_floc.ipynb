        "While this approach offers superior results compared to the deterministic model, it significantly increases the problem's complexity.\n",
        "In this section, we delve into the Benders decomposition technique, applying it to our two-stage stochastic problem using AMPL's advanced features. \n",
        "This method aims to provide a 'robust' solution that is adaptable to any future customer demand scenario, yet avoids the complexity of solving a large, monolithic problem by breaking it down into more manageable subproblems.\n",

        "We'll explore three additional methods for implementing Benders decomposition, with the `amplpy` module managing the algorithm's control flow. \n",
        "This transition will further allow us to showcase the parallel processing of subproblems.\n",

        "Implementing the Benders decomposition algorithm was straightforward, largely because we built upon the extensive form of our stochastic programming problem. \n",
        "However, there are a few important caveats to consider in our approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **API Integration**: In production environments, AMPL is often used through an API. It would be beneficial to shift the algorithm's control flow to the API level for better integration and flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Parallelization of Subproblems**: Our analysis highlighted that the subproblems are independent, allowing for the possibility of parallel execution. For complex subproblems or when dealing with a large number of scenarios, parallelizing these computations could markedly improve efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Solver Instances**: Each time we issue a solve command for the master or subproblems, a new solver instance is created. While AMPL provides initial values, the solver might not utilize them, essentially solving each problem from scratch. This approach can overlook valuable information that could be leveraged if the problems were persistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following section, we will explore how to utilize AMPL's Python API to move the algorithm's control flow to the API level."
