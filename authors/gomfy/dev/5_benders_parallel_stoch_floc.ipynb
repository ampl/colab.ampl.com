        "**We will initiate separate AMPL processes for each subproblem, in addition to one for the master problem, resulting in a total of \"number of scenarios plus one\" AMPL processes.**\n",

        "- **Data Management**: We employ dictionaries for each data type (Python lists, Pandas data frames) to streamline and clarify data loading operations, reducing code redundancy.\n",
        "- **Core Availability Check**: We assess the number of available processor cores. If the number of scenarios exceeds the available cores, we issue a warning to the user.\n",
        "- **AMPL Object Initialization**: For each scenario, we initialize an `ampl_dict` object, each containing an AMPL object configured to run as an independent process.\n",
        "- **Subproblem Executor**: We establish `sub_executor`, a dedicated object for managing the execution of subproblems.\n",
        "- **While Loop Execution**: The iterative process begins similarly to previous implementations, but with the solve operations are conducted outside the for loop in parallel.\n",
        "- **Violation Checks and Cuts**: Within the for loop, we simply identify violations and append the necessary cuts to the master problem.\n",
