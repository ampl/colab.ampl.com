        "Description: This notebook continues our six-part series as the second installment. \n",
        "In the first part, we tackled a basic facility location problem, showcasing the use of AMPL and the `amplpy` module within a Jupyter Notebook to derive a solution. \n",
        "Our analysis revealed that for low to medium customer demand scenarios, two facilities are adequate. \n",
        "However, a spike in demand necessitates the activation of a third facility.\n",
        "In this section, we delve into the stochastic programming formulation of our problem.\n",
        "This approach aims to provide a 'robust' solution that accommodates any potential customer demand scenario in the future. \n",
        "Moving on to the third notebook of the series, we will transition our focus from modeling to the development of algorithms within AMPL. \n",
        "We plan to examine four unique methods for implementing the Benders decomposition, starting with AMPL scripting before moving the control flow over to the `amplpy` module. \n",
        "This shift will demonstrate the parallel solving of subproblems. \n",
        "Finally, we will introduce the AMPLS library, designed to enhance the efficiency of Benders decomposition by allowing AMPL model instances to be exported as persistent solver representations.\n",

        "However, the transition has resulted in an increase in complexity: **the number of variables has expanded from 15 to 39, and the number of constraints has risen from 8 to 22**. \n",
        "While this change is manageable for a small-scale problem, the complexity could grow exponentially with larger problems and additional scenarios.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the face of such complexity, what strategies are available? \n",
        "Fortunately, for two-stage stochastic programming problems like ours, a solution exists. \n",
        "The first-stage decisions involve determining which facilities to open, while the second-stage decisions focus on how to meet customer demand with the available facilities. \n",
        "This inherent structure allows for the problem to be broken down into a master problem and sub-problems, significantly reducing the complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following section, we will explore the implementation of this decomposition strategy, known as Benders decomposition, within AMPL."
