        "The goal of the capacitated $p$-median problem (CPMP) is to fix $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ locations as medians from a given number of $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ locations. Furthermore, we are given demands $q_{i} \\geq 0$ and capacities $Q_{i} \\geq 0$ for every location $i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ as well as distances $d_{ij} \\geq 0$ for each pair of locations $i,j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$. While fixing the medians, we also assign every location $i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ to exactly one median such that the demands of all locations assigned to the median can be satisfied by the capacity of the median. An assignment of locations to a median is called a cluster. The overall objective is to minimize the total distance between the medians and their assigned locations.\n",
