        "## 1. Introduction to Open Pit Mining <a id=\"1-introduction\"></a>\n",
        "\n",
        "Open pit mining is a surface mining technique used to extract minerals from the earth by removing layers of rock and soil. The extracted material is discretized into **blocks**, each containing estimated amounts of ore (valuable mineral) and waste. The key decisions involve determining which blocks to extract and when, subject to various operational and geometric constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "**Block Model:** The mineral deposit is represented as a three-dimensional grid of blocks. Each block has associated attributes such as position $(x, y, z)$, tonnage, ore grade, and estimated economic value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Precedence Constraints:** Due to geotechnical requirements for pit wall stability and equipment access, blocks cannot be extracted in arbitrary order. If block $a$ lies above block $b$, then $a$ must be extracted before $b$. These relationships form a directed acyclic graph where edges represent \"must be extracted before\" relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pit Slope:** The angle at which the pit walls are maintained to prevent collapse. This angle determines which blocks must be removed to access deeper blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cutoff Grade:** The minimum ore concentration that makes a block economically viable for processing. Blocks below this threshold are typically sent to waste dumps.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Optimization?\n",
        "\n",
        "Mining operations represent massive capital investments spanning decades. A typical open pit mine may contain millions of blocks, and the extraction sequence significantly impacts profitability due to the time value of money. Early extraction of high-value ore maximizes net present value (NPV). Mathematical optimization helps mine planners make informed decisions about pit design and production scheduling."
