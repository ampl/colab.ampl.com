        "Power system optimization is a critical aspect of modern electrical engineering, enabling efficient energy dispatch, grid stability, and cost-effective operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Amplpower** is a powerful Python library designed to model and solve power system optimization problems using **AMPL**, a fast modeling language for large-scale mathematical optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "*This package is developed by Salvador Pineda (spineda@uma.es), an Associate Professor at University of Malaga and member of the OASYS Research Group (https://sites.google.com/view/groupoasys/home).*\n",

        "## **What is Amplpower?**\n",
        "Amplpower provides an intuitive interface to formulate and solve **Optimal Power Flow (OPF)** problems reading \".m\" Matpower files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Built on top of **AMPL** and compatible with the solvers AMPL support like **Gurobi, IPOPT, HiGHS, Knitro**, and many more.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Amplpower features**\n",
        "* 🐍 **Python-native workflow** - Combine optimization with virtual environments, data analysis, visualization, and your continuous integration / continuous development pipeline.\n",
        "* 🚀 **Fastest model instantiation speed** - AMPL is a modeling language designed to instantiate complex models fast, so it is ideal to write OPF problems, and other kinds of energy problems.\n",
        "* ✅ **Flexibility to formulate the model** - The package provide several options to choose the model being solved. Furthermore, the model is written in AMPL syntax, so it is easy to understand, modify, and enhance, letting researchers use the default models from the package or even write their own ones.\n",
        "* ✅ **Support for multiple solvers** - Every solver supported by AMPL is available, commercial and open-source ones, under the appropriate license.\n",

        "For detailed documentation, visit: **[Amplpower Docs](https://amplpower.readthedocs.io)**  .\n",
        "\n",
        "Since Amplpower is an open-source project, to run the models you will need an Ampl license. You can get a free Community Edition at https://portal.ampl.com, and activate the license (this happens by default when you run from Google Colab).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notebook steps\n",
        "1. Installing the amplpower package\n",
        "2. Activating an Ampl license for a notebook (by default in Google Colab it is a Community Edition license)\n",
        "3. Download a power system from Matpower, like 'case9.m' (https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower/blob/master/data/case9.m)\n",
        "4. Solve case9.m for different OPF formulations."
