        "\n",
        "The NFL team rating problem shows that an nonlinear optimization model can be used to predict game match performances. The above example illustrates that teams can be rated in such a way to minimize the prediction errors for game outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key take away of the above example is that the team ratings should be controlled at a standard level (85 in this case). The reason is that without such a standard level, there exists an infinite set of optimal solutions that achieve the same RMSE. The standard level, however, can be set at any number.\n",
        "\n",
        "One potential issue with the above team rating optimization approach is that the ratings can over fit historical performance. An exponential weighted performance approach can partially overcome this issue but putting more weight on more recent matches and less weight on distant matchings. However, given that the regular season is not very long, such an issue is unlikely to be a significant concern."
