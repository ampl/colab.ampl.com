        "In the competitive landscape of retail, managing procurement and sales strategies effectively is critical for profitability. This model addresses the complexities of retail operations by optimizing procurement plans, balancing supplier payment schemes, and accounting for variable demand, storage constraints, and losses. By incorporating a detailed financial framework, the model aims to maximize the retail chain's profit while adhering to operational and contractual requirements.\n",

        "The retail chain ***\"YourRetail\"*** operates by offering a wide range of products sourced from suppliers and manufacturers. To maintain its competitive edge, ***\"YourRetail\"*** applies a standard trade markup of 25%. However, managing inventory, cash flow, and overall profitability is challenging due to the dynamic nature of demand, which is influenced by seasonal elasticity.  \n",

        "  - Remaining 50% after one month, with a 5% price increase compared to Scheme A.  \n",
