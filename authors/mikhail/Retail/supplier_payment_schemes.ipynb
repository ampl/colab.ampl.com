    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the competitive landscape of retail, managing procurement and sales strategies effectively is critical for profitability. This model addresses the complexities of retail operations by optimizing procurement plans, balancing supplier payment schemes, and accounting for variable demand, storage constraints, and losses. By incorporating a detailed financial framework, the model aims to maximize the retail chain's profit while adhering to operational and contractual requirements.\n",

    "# 1. Problem Statement  \n",
    "\n",
    "The retail chain ***\"YourRetail\"*** operates by offering a wide range of products sourced from suppliers and manufacturers. To maintain its competitive edge, ***\"YourRetail\"*** applies a standard trade markup of 25%. However, managing inventory, cash flow, and overall profitability is challenging due to the dynamic nature of demand, which is influenced by seasonal elasticity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of the Problem  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Product Assortment  \n",
    "- ***\"YourRetail\"*** offers 50 product types, [each with different purchase prices](Price.csv) depending on the payment scheme used.  \n",
    "- Prices are categorized as follows:  \n",
    "  - **Price A**: Cost under Scheme A.  \n",
    "  - **Price B**: Cost under Scheme B (5% higher than Price A).  \n",
    "  - **Price C**: Cost under Scheme C (10% higher than Price A).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Payment Schemes  \n",
    "***\"YourRetail\"*** employs three distinct payment schemes, each impacting cash flow and procurement costs:  \n",
    "- **Scheme A**: Full payment is made upon receipt of goods.  \n",
    "- **Scheme B**: Payment is split into two installments:  \n",
    "  - 50% upon delivery.  \n",
    "  - Remaining 50% after one month, with a 5% price increase compared to Scheme A.  \n",
    "- **Scheme C**: Goods are accepted on consignment, with full payment made one month after delivery. The purchase price increases by 10% compared to Scheme A.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Demand and Planning Horizon  \n",
    "- [Weekly demand forecasts for all 50 products are available for the next 27 weeks.](Retail.csv)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage Capacity and Costs  \n",
    "- ***\"YourRetail\"*** operates a warehouse with a total capacity of **2,000 square meters**.  \n",
    "- Weekly storage cost is **$0.10 per square meter**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Financial Constraints  \n",
    "- Initial working capital: **$15,000**.  \n",
    "- Discount rate: **5% annually**, representing the time value of money.  "
