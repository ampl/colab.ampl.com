        "When developing and conducting advertising campaigns, companies strive to maximize the effectiveness of their advertising dollars. In this case, the effectiveness of advertising is measured by the degree to which the campaign goals are achieved. The main goals of an advertising campaign can be:\n",
        "-  Increase in sales;\n",
        "-  Attraction of new clients;\n",
        "- Launch of a new product on the market;\n",
        "- Increasing/maintaining market share or profit level.\n",
        "\n",
        "When developing and planning an advertising campaigns, it is necessary to take into account many factors that influence the final effectiveness of advertising, namely:\n",
        "- Characteristics of advertising channels (availability, cost, etc.);\n",
        "- Structure and composition of the target audience of each advertising channel;\n",
        "- Conversion rates for various advertising channels;\n",
        "- Limitation of the budget allocated for advertising;\n",
        "- Cost of 1 impression/click;\n",
        "- Localization of the target audience;\n",
        "- The intensity of advertising displays during the day, week;\n",
        "- Marketing activity of competitors;\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematical optimization allows you to synchronize all the specified factors and limitations of advertising channels with each other, and determine, among many options, the most effective (from the point of view of campaign goals) plan for investing in advertising.\n",
