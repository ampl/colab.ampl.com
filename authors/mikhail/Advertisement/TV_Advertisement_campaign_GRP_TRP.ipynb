        "When developing and conducting advertising campaigns, companies strive to maximize the effectiveness of their advertising dollars. In this case, the effectiveness of advertising is measured by the degree to which the campaign goals are achieved. The main goals of an advertising campaign can be:\n",
        "-  Increase in sales;\n",
        "-  Attraction of new clients;\n",
