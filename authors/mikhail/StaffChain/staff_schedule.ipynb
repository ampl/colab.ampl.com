    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The presented optimization model aims to assign employees to pharmacies within a branch network, ensuring efficient staff allocation to meet customer demand while maximizing total profit. The model takes into account the following key elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Pharmacies and Branches:*** The model organizes pharmacies within branches, considering their distinct working hours, distance between them, and daily sales and revenue data for different times of the day and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Employee Assignment:*** Employees are assigned to pharmacies based on various constraints, including their base workplaces, maximum distance for reassignment, sales performance, and individual working hours or vacation schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Shift Types:*** Different shift types with specific attributes such as daily work hours, overtime allowances, and weekly or yearly working hour limits are defined. The model ensures that employees are not overworked and adhere to these limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Staffing and Demand Management:*** The model incorporates the concept of peak hours and days, requiring additional staff to meet higher demand. A penalty is applied when the staffing level falls short of the expected sales demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Revenue and Costs:*** The objective function maximizes the total profit by balancing pharmacy revenue, employee salary costs (including overtime), and penalties for unmet demand. The model dynamically adjusts for sales performance, ensuring that employees with higher performance are prioritized for assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Constraints:*** Multiple constraints are implemented to regulate the schedule, such as ensuring employees work only one continuous shift per cycle, do not exceed weekly or yearly overtime limits, and are assigned in accordance with their capacity to meet pharmacy sales demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model optimizes employee allocation across a network of pharmacies, striving to meet customer demand while minimizing costs and ensuring compliance with labor regulations.\n",

    "## 2. Pharmacy Network Overview\n",
    "There are historical data on sales of the pharmacy chain for the same period a year earlier. Available data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://github.com/ampl/colab.ampl.com/blob/master/authors/mikhail/StaffChain/staff_schedule.jpg?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Pharmacy Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branch Name**: The specific branch to which a pharmacy belongs, providing organizational context.\n",
    "- **Pharmacy Address**: The physical location of each pharmacy, crucial for understanding regional performance and logistics.\n",
    "- **Operating Days per Week**: The number of days each pharmacy is open, affecting sales potential and staffing needs.\n",
    "- **Working Hours per Day**: The total hours each pharmacy is operational daily, influencing sales opportunities and shift planning.\n",
    "- **Geotags**: Geographical coordinates of each pharmacy, useful for mapping and regional analysis.\n",
    "Please review initial data [here](Pharmacies.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Sales Data\n",
    "- **Transaction Date and Time**: The exact timestamp of each sale, essential for analyzing peak sales periods and daily trends.\n",
    "- **Pharmacy Location**: The specific pharmacy where the transaction took place, allowing for location-based sales analysis.\n",
    "- **Salesperson**: The individual responsible for the sale, linking performance metrics to specific employees.\n",
    "- **Items Sold**: The quantity of products sold during each transaction, critical for inventory management and sales tracking.\n",
    "- **Profit Generated**: The profit margin on each sale, providing financial insights at both micro (per transaction) and macro (overall network) levels.\n",
    "Please review initial data [here](Sales.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Personnel Data\n",
    "- **Hourly Wages**: The pay rate for employees, essential for calculating labor costs and analyzing payroll expenses.\n",
    "- **Base Pharmacy**: The primary location where an employee is assigned, relevant for tracking employee movement and shift assignments.\n",
    "- **Replacement Distance**: The maximum distance a worker can travel to temporarily work at a different pharmacy when needed.\n",
    "- **SalesPerformance**: Employee sales performance for priority scheduling.\n",
    "- **Vacation Preferences**: The preferred start dates for employee vacations, aiding in scheduling and ensuring adequate staffing during peak periods.\n",
    "- **Vacation Duration**: Duration of vacation, days.\n",
    "Please review initial data [here](Employees.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The network uses three distinct work methods, each designed to meet different operational needs and governed by specific rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Base Work Method\n",
    "- **Daily Work Hours**: Employees work standard 8-hour shifts.\n",
    "- **Weekly Work Hours**: Total work hours per week are capped at 40.\n",
    "- **Overtime Rules**: Employees can work up to 2 and 8 additional hours per day and week respectively, with an annual limit of 96 hours. Overtime is compensated at double the regular wage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Rotational Work Method\n",
    "- **Shift Duration**: Shifts can be up to 12 hours long.\n",
    "- **Work Schedule**: Employees work for 2 consecutive days, followed by 2 days off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Additional Work Method\n",
    "- **Work Hours**: Employees can work up to 4 hours per day, accommodating those seeking part-time roles.\n",
    "- **Overtime Rules**: Employees can work up to 2 and 8 additional hours per day and week respectively, with an annual limit of 96 hours. Overtime is compensated at double the regular wage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Rules\n",
    "The pharmacy network adheres to several overarching rules designed to maintain a fair and efficient work environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weekly Workdays**: Employees are limited to working a maximum of 6 days per week to prevent burnout.\n",
    "- **Vacation Entitlement**: Employees are entitled to n days of leave per year.\n",
    "- **Schedule Flexibility**: Work schedules can only be adjusted every 14 days to maintain stability in staffing and operations.\n",
    "- **Peak Demand**: During peak hours (12PM - 20PM) and peak season (4-5 months of the year), staff must be assigned to meet demand equal to the available data +10%."
