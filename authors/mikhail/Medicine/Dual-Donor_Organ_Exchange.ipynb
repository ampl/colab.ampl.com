        "Description:  Most transplants from living donors require only one donor for each procedure. There are, however, exceptions, including dual-graft liver transplantation, bilateral living-donor lobar lung transplantation, and simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation. For each of these procedures, grafts from two compatible living donors are transplanted. As such, these procedures are more involved from an organizational perspective than those with only one donor. Unfortunately, one or both of the donors can often be biologically incompatible with the intended recipient, precluding the transplantation.\n",
        "One way to overcome this potential barrier to transplantation is by an exchange of donors between patients. \n",
        "The mathematical optimization model presented here identifies and maximizes the number of cross-compatibilities between patients and donors, thereby maximizing the number of possible transplants and their variations within the available set of patients and donors.\n",
