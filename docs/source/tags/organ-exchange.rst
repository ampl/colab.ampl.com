| Description: Most transplants from living donors require only one donor for each procedure. There are, however, exceptions, including dual-graft liver transplantation, bilateral living-donor lobar lung transplantation, and simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation. For each of these procedures, grafts from two compatible living donors are transplanted. As such, these procedures are more involved from an organizational perspective than those with only one donor. Unfortunately, one or both of the donors can often be biologically incompatible with the intended recipient, precluding the transplantation.
